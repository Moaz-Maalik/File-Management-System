# File-Management-System
A program which manages read and write access of multiple files using different Data Structures 
like Linked List, Hash Table , Priority Queues and Stack.

This is a File Management system which locks and unlocks different files . Files can be read by more the one user at a time 
but it cant be written by more than 1 user at a time. Thus the program locks that file until a user has finished writing on that file.
These tasks are performed through the use of different data structures .
